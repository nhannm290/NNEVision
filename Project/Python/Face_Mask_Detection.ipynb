        "The coronavirus was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11th, 2020, and by that time, we already had 118,000 confirmed cases and had spread to 114 countries around the globe. Since then, due to a variety of reasons some of which include strict measures not being put into place and government negligence, we have seen these figures blown out of proportions.  Currently, at the time of writing this, we have 13.7 million confirmed cases and near 586,000 deaths worldwide. While some factors can be eluded as being not being under our control as individuals, we cannot say that face masks do not have a big role to play in controlling this pandemic.\n",

        "(***and why is it not a personal choice to wear masks in public places?***)....<br>\n",
        "Upon wearing the face mask, we as the source of infection reduce the number of droplets ejected by 99 percent according to confirmed studies. It also reduces the intake of number of droplets by an uninfected individual, though not as effective. Yet, if we reduce the number of people getting infected, it also reduces the effective reproduction rate, and hence having an impact of exponential margins.\n",
        "Nearly half of the infected people do not show symptoms as per recent studies, which can take up to a period of 14 days to appear in an infected individual. Hence, it is really necessary for wearing masks by people in public places, and should really be made mandatory rather than being based on individual decisions, as a significant portion of people with infection lack coronavirus symptoms.\n",
        "We cannot wait for a controlled trial of a vaccination to be successful for us to be taking all the preventive steps to protect ourselves and others, while contributing to stop the flow of this disease. A successful vaccination won't come till at least the mid of next year, and we cannot ascertain that it would immediately be made publicly available even then by every nation. It can be safely stated that wearing masks is not a personal choice as it can put us and people around us at risk of infection.\n",

        "Face Detection is the technique of identifying human faces in digital images. While inherently a backbone to other applications, detecting a face is in fact impacted a lot in cluttered scenes, and examples of the same kind of problem can be thought of in a crowded setting, the use-case for which our mask detection algorithm is being built. For this reason, having tried various techniques from classical Computer Vision domain to using deep learning techniques, I needed to prioritize the mAP metric of detected faces in a crowded setting. Having said that, I tried techniques for face detection such as Haar cascading and MT-CNN which did not achieve a high recall. Finally, I sided with a pre-trained RetinaNet Face model, using focal loss which is able to handle the foreground-background class imbalance (an issue with one stage detectors which makes performance of single shot detectors inferior to two stage detectors for object detection) in the detected classes pretty well.\n",
